Hello and Welcome to my GitHub page ðŸ‘‹

Since May 2024 I have decided to explore the world of Computational Science. /
For that reason, I have completed an online course in Python and SQL.

In order to expand my expertise in the field of computer science, I am currently enrolled in a Data Scientist training program.
During the first module, focused on Data Engineering, I acquired in-depth knowledge in the areas of data modeling, data warehousing, ETL processes, data quality, and data cleansing procedures. In particular, I engaged extensively with the modeling of star, snowflake, and galaxy schemas. For the practice-oriented final exam, I focused on implementing a Data Vault, which not only enhanced my analytical and problem-solving skills but also demonstrated my ability to work effectively in a team. The ongoing Data Analytics course provides techniques for data analysis and preparation using libraries such as NumPy and Pandas. Functions from the Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly Express libraries are employed for data visualization and exploratory analyses. Dashboards are created with Dash for interactive charts. In the Machine Learning module, common algorithms such as Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines from the fields of supervised and unsupervised learning are applied, as well as working with complex neural networks. To this end, the basics of Convolutional Neural Networks and Recurrent Neural Networks are covered in the Deep Learning Module.

I will use GitHub mainly to present my day-to-day accomplishments in a certain project and to share with you my approach and code.
If you find any mistake or even a better way how to write a query, I would deeply appreciate your help!
With this being said, let's code ðŸ˜„
