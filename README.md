Hello and Welcome to my GitHub page ðŸ‘‹

Since May 2024 I have decided to explore the world of Computational Science. 

For that reason, I have completed a course in Python and currently, I am signed up for a SQL online course.

My goal is to expand my hands-on expertise in machine learning to apply it to a chemistry or biology-related topic.

I will use GitHub mainly to present my day-to-day accomplishments in a certain project and to share with you my approach and code.

If you find any mistake or even a better way how to write a query, I would deeply appreciate your help!

With this being said, let's code ðŸ˜„
